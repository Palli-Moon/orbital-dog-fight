## Download Instructions

The `bin` directory of this repository contains OSX, Linux and Windows binaries
precompiled. These should run like any other application
-  OSX: it may be necessary to bypass Gatekeeper (by secondary clicking the icon
and clicking open whilst holding the option key) in order to run the
application.
- Linux: make the binary file executable by using `chmod +x <filename>`
- Server: To run an headless server version of the game (dedicated server)
use the binary in bin/server passing as an argument "server.xml" 
(ie. `./odf_server.bin server.xml`)
## Build Instructions
To build this software the [GODOT](http://www.godotengine.org/) game
engine is required <sup>[1](#myfootnote1)</sup>, as well as the
[git](http://git-scm.com/) version control system.

Install the export templates
- that can be found on the godot download page
http://www.godotengine.org/wp/download/.
- if using the custom engine build the export templates also using the
following command from within the godot repository `scons platform=<platform>
tools=no target=release bits=64`. After building the desired templates compress
them into a '.zip' file and change the extension to `.tpz`.

The templates can be directly imported into the editor by clicking `Settings ->
Install Export Templates`

Clone this repository `git clone
https://github.com/Palli-Moon/orbital-dog-fight.git` and import the project into
godot. Then click the `Export` button, choose your target platform, set the
options as desired, then click `Export` to export the file to a `.zip`
containing the executable.

<a name="myfootnote1">[1]</a>: Some features require an experimental version of
the engine which can be found on the `gravity_distance_2d` branch at
https://github.com/Faless/godot. The game still runs with the standard build,
but gravity does not scale with distance.
